The Book of V
=============

The goal of this book is to teach the V language from the beginning. This book
is a work in progress and I'll be editing and including new chapters as I too
discover more about this new language. The book versions are released as
separate `Git <https://www.git-scm.com/>`_ tags containing assets hopefully
satifying everyone's taste in reading formats.

See something incorrectly described, buggy or want to contribute a chapter of
your own? Feel free to send a pull request and we will find a way to include
it!
